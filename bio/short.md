Years ago, Ryan created the first data science blog on the internet. He was placed on influential lists, named a thought-leader, and invited to conferences. During that time, he discovered the power of being present on the internet. 

Recently, Ryan has started The Example Show where he interviews people and creates an example of how to start your own weekly internet show.
